# stableMatching

This reposotory includes codes to calculate all stable matchings in the matching with contract setting.

## Functions
Functions are defined in 'stableMatching/libs'. 
Each file includes an independent module to execute one functionality.
The main algorithm is defined in 'stableMatching/libs/runAlgo.m', and other functions complement this file.

## Test
All functions are tested in 'tests'.
For example, five test cases for 'stableMatching/libs/runAlgo.m' are validated in 'tests/runAlgoTest.m'.

## Example
Execution for dummy data are done in 'stableMatching/stableMtchDummy.mlx'
